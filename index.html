<p> Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education advocate who, at the age of 17, became the youngest person</br> to win the Nobel Peace Prize after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban. Born on July 12, 1997,</br> Yousafzai became an advocate for girls' education when she herself was still a child, which</br> resulted in the Taliban issuing a death threat against her. On October 9, 2012, a gunman shot Malala when she was traveling home from school.</br> She survived and has continued to speak out on the importance of education. In 2013, she gave a speech to the</br> United Nations and published her first book, I Am Malala. In 2014, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p>Nine months after being shot by the Taliban, Malala Yousafzai gave a speech at the United Nations on her 16th birthday in 2013.</br> Yousafzai highlighted her focus on education and women's rights, urging world leaders to change their policies.</br></br>

Yousafzai said that following the attack, “the terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions, </br> but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage were born.”</br></br>

She also urged action against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism:</br>

“The extremists were, and they are, afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them.</br> They are afraid of women... Let us pick up our books and pens. They are our most powerful weapons.”</p>
